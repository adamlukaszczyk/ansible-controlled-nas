# Only listen to routers' LAN NIC.  Doing so opens up tcp/udp port 53 to
# localhost and udp port 67 to world:
interface=mytap

# dnsmasq will open tcp/udp port 53 and udp port 67 to world to help with
# dynamic interfaces (assigning dynamic ips). Dnsmasq will discard world
# requests to them, but the paranoid might like to close them and let the 
# kernel handle them:
bind-interfaces

# Dynamic range of IPs to make available to LAN pc
dhcp-range=mytap,10.0.3.2,10.0.3.20,255.255.255.0,12h

# If youâ€™d like to have dnsmasq assign static IPs, bind the LAN computer's
# NIC MAC address:
dhcp-host=52:54:BE:EF:96:D4,10.0.3.2
